    "\n",
    "An expression is made up of operators and operands and all expressions tend to evaluate to a single value.\n",

    "\n",
    "A statement is an action or a command that does something. Here, the value of 10 is assigned to the variable spam.\n",
    "An expression is operands and operators yielding something. eg: spam = 10+2 which evaluates to a single value of 12.\n",
