    "- They are square brackets which denote a list.\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "- The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "- The difference between append() and insert() is that insert function allows us to add a specific element at a specified index of the list unlike append() where we can add the element only at end of the list.\n",
    "append() takes 1 argument i.e. the item to be inserted whereas insert takes 2 arguments i.e. the index at which it needs to be inserted and the item to be inserted.\n",

    "- by using list() and tuple() respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "- They contain references to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "- copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object - you change the original object. .deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Changing new deepcopied object doesn't affect original object.\n"
