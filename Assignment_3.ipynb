    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read and easier to update.\n",
    "Reusability is another reason.Once a function is defined, it can used over and over again.\n",
    "Another reason is abstraction. You dont need to know what is inside a function to use it. You only need the name of the function and the arguments to run a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "- When its called, it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "- The “def” keyword is a statement for defining a function in Python followed by the function's name and semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "- Function is a piece of code created that has all the steps to do a specific task. A function call is what you write to execute the function you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "- There is 1 global scope and 1 local scope in the python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "- All variables in local scope are destroyed once the function call returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "- Values that a function returns after its completed are called return values. No, its not possible to have return values in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "If a function doesn't specify a return value, it returns None. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "- If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "- Nonetype\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "- It imports the module areallyourpetsnamederic into python to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "- spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "- If you have a block of code that might fail, you can manage any exceptions by placing this code in a try: … except: … block.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "- The try clause has the code you want to execute. If you run into an error in the try clause, then the block of code within except clause is executed. \n"
