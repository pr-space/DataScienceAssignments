    "Q8. Functions are said to be “first-class objects” in Python but not in most other languages, such as C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can't do in C or C++?\n",
    "> You can store the function in a variable.\n",
    "You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",
    "You can return the function from a function.\n",

    "Q9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Wrappers around the functions are also knows as decorators which are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Generator functions are a special kind of function that return a iterator object (lazy iterator). These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a generator function in the Python language?\n",
    "> use yield\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "> We can write simple and compact code using generators."
