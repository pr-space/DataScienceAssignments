    "Q1) What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "> Provides a clear program structure and a clean code\n",

    "Q2) Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  by looking in object, then in all classes above it, from bottom to top and left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3) How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "> An instance is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the example below, when class course is written, a class object is created whereas the instance object is created when an object is realised by naming the class and adding parenthesis to it.\n",

    "Q4) What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5) What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "> The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6) What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Create a class\n",
    "\n",
    "> call the class using class name and assign it to a variable (object variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "> pass in whatever arguments its init method accepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7) What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "> process to create class\n",
    "\n",
    "- class definition starts with keyword class\n",
    "- follwed by classname and ':'\n",
    "- class will have doc string\n",
    "- class should have at least one statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8) How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass"
