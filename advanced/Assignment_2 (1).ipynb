    "Q1) What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "> Modules are collections of methods and constants. They cannot generate instances. \n",
    "Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A class may inherit from another class, but not from a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module may not inherit from anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2) How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "> process to create class\n",
    "\n",
    "- class definition starts with keyword class\n",
    "- follwed by classname and ':'\n",
    "- class will have doc string\n",
    "- class should have at least one statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3) Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    " > We define class attributes outside all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4) Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "> Instance attributes are defined in the constructor. Defined directly inside a class. Defined inside a constructor using the self parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5) What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "> self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6) How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    ">  To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that \n",
    "is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when we use + operator, \n",
    "the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7) When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "> When you have to perform arithmetic or comparison operations between objects of a user-defined class, you should consider operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8) What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The + Operator is most popular\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9) What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "\n",
    "> two key concepts of OOP which are inheritance and polymorphism. Both inheritance and polymorphism are key ingredients for designing robust, flexible, and easy-to-maintain software"
