    "Q3) How do you slice a list to get any other part while missing the rest? \n",

    "Q4) Explain the distinctions between indexing and slicing.\n",
    "> “Indexing” means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable.\n",
    "“Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an iterable based on their indices.\n",

    "Q7) What is the concept of an unbalanced matrix?\n",
    "> Whenever the cost matrix of an assignment problem is not a square matrix, that is, whenever the number of sources is not equal to the number of destinations, the assignment problem is called an unbalanced assignment problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8) Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
    "> List comprehensions are powerful tools for processing such structures because they automatically scan rows and columns for us. For example, though this structure stores the matrix by rows, to collect the second column we can simply iterate across the rows and pull out the desired column"
