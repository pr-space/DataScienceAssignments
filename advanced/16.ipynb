    "Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "> Form Validation\n",
    "The most common use of regular expressions is form validation, i.e. email validation, password validation, phone number validation, and many other fields of the form.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Bank Account details\n",
    "You must have noticed that every bank has an IFSC code for its different branches that starts with the name of the bank. The credit card number consists of 16 digits and the first few digits represent whether the card is Master, Visa, or Rupay. In all these cases, regex is used.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data Mining\n",
    "How can we forget the importance of regex in data mining? When the data is present in unstructured form, i.e. in text form, it needs to be converted to numbers to train the model. Therefore, regex plays an important role in analyzing the data, find patterns in the data, and finally performing operations on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">NLP\n",
    "NLP is a process through which a computer understands and generates human language. In NLP, regular expressions are used to remove the unnecessary words i.e., stop words from the text—thus helps in data cleaning. Regex is also used in analyzing the texts and thus helps in the prediction of the algorithm to process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Social Media Platforms\n",
    "Social Media Platforms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter provide several techniques to search, which are different and efficient from a normal search. Believe me, if you know these techniques, you can explore much more. All these techs use regex in the backend to process these searches.\n",
    "You can think of various other applications of regular expressions wherever pattern matching is required\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Describe the difference between the effects of \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+.\" Which of these, if any, is the unqualified pattern \"abc+\"?\n",
    ">Both (ab)c+ and a(bc)+ are valid patterns. the difference between both these patterns is in (ab)c+ ab is group whereas in a(bc)+ bc is a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How much do you need to use the following sentence while using regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    ">import re statement always has to be imported before using regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Which characters have special significance in square brackets when expressing a range, and under what circumstances?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Characters .,*,?,^,or,(), have a special signiface when used with square brackets. They need not be be explicitly escaped by \\ as in case of pattern texts in a raw string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How does compiling a regular-expression object benefit you?\n",
    ">We can Combine a regular expression pattern into pattern Objects.Which can be used for pattern matching. it also helps to search a pattern again without rewritting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are some examples of how to use the match object returned by re.match and re.search?\n",
    "> The re.search() and re.match() both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match() searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "While re.search() searches for the whole string even if the string contains multi-lines and tries to find a match of the substring in all the lines of string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the difference between using a vertical bar (|) as an alteration and using square brackets as a character set?\n",
    "\n",
    ">When | us used then patterns searches for or option. i.e <pattern_1>|<pattern_2> means it searches as <pattern_1>or<<pattern_2> in the searched string. the first occurance of matched string will be returned as the Match Object. Using Character set in square Brackets searches for all the character set in the square bracket and if match is found, it returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. In regular-expression search patterns, why is it necessary to use the raw-string indicator (r)? In   replacement strings?\n",
    ">  Raw Strings are used in the regular-expression search patterns, so that blackslashes donot have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n"
