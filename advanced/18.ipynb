    "Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph. \n",
    "> In text file, text, character, numbers are stored one character per byte i.e. 32667 occupies 5 bytes even though it occupies 2 bytes in memory.\n",
    "In binary file data is stored in binary format and each data would occupy the same number of bytes on disks as it occupies in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the text file, the newline character is converted to carriage-return/linefeed before being written to the disk.\n",
    "In binary file, conversion of newline to carriage-return and linefeed does not take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files are used to store data more user friendly.\n",
    "Binary files are used to store data more compactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the text file, a special character whose ASCII value is 26 inserted after the last character to mark the end of file.\n",
    "In the binary file no such character is present. Files keep track of the end of the file from the number of characters present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content written in text files is human readable.\n",
    "Content written in binary files is not human readable and looks like encrypted content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option?\n",
    "When would you like to use binary files instead of text files? \n",
    ">When file does need to be read by people or need to be ported to a different type of system text files should be preferred over binary files.\n",
    "Q3. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "Ans: When we read or write a python integer using binary operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary operations deal with raw data\n",
    "One needs to identify how many bytes one would read or write.\n",
    "Q4. Describe a benefit of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file ?\n",
    "Ans: When a file is opened using the with keyword, if some exceptions occur after opening a file, or at the end of the file it automatically does the closing of the file. There by not leaving an file in open mode and there would no need to explicitly close a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Does Python have the trailing newline while reading a line of text? Does Python append a newline when you write a line of text?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Python have the trailing newline while reading a line of text. When we write a newline has to be provided in python excpicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What file operations enable for random-access operation?\n",
    "Ans: The file operations enable for random-access operation are seek() and tell()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. When do you think you'll use the struct package the most?\n",
    "Ans: The struct package is mostly used while converting a common python types into C language types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. When is pickling the best option?\n",
    "Ans: Pickling is best option for creating a new binary file using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. When will it be best to use the shelve package?\n",
    "Ans: Shelve package is used to pickle data but treats the entire file as dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is a special restriction when using the shelve package, as opposed to using other data dictionaries?\n",
    "Ans: Only string data type can be used as key in this special dictionary object, whereas any picklable Python object can be used as value."
