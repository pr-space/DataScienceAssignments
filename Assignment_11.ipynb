    "2) Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",

    "- print messages would have to be commented out in production which is tiresome while logging messages can be toggled with a single line of code - They can be displayed or the messages can be sent to a file on server.\n",

    "         complete the entire function call.\n",
    "   out  - execute the lines of code unti it returns from the current function.\n",
    "        (out is useful when you stepped into a function call).\n",

    "- until the program ends or reaches a breakpoint set.\n",

    "11) What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "- When you press go, you can have your debugger run and stop at the lines selected to be the breakpoint. "
