    "1) What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects? \n",
    "> re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "> A rawstring is a string literal (prefixed with an r) in which the normal escaping rules have been suspended so that everything is a literal. This is incredibly useful for writing readable regular expressions or any string literals that will be processed by other escaping systems such as SQL parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is the return value of the search() method? \n",
    "> The index of the first match between the regular expression and the given string, or -1 if no match was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern? \n",
    "\n",
    "5) In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1? \n",
    "> regex: (\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "    The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. \n",
    "    The second set will be group 2. \n",
    "    By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the group() match object method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. \n",
    "    Passing 0 or nothing to the group() method will return the entire matched text\n",
    "\n",
    "6) In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a\n",
    "regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods? \n",
    "> Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. \n",
    "What causes it to return one of the two options? \n",
    "> If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is \n",
    "returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) In standard expressions, what does the | character mean? \n",
    "> The | character signifies matching “either, or” between two groups\n",
    "\n",
    "9) In regular expressions, what does the character stand for? \n",
    ">The ? character can either mean “match zero or one of the preceding group”\n",
    "\n",
    "10)In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters? \n",
    ">The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more\n",
    "\n",
    "11) What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression? \n",
    "> The {4} matches exactly 4 instances of the preceding group. \n",
    "    The {4,5} matches between 4 and five instances\n",
    "\n",
    "12) What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions? \n",
    "> The \\d, stands for single digit, Any numeric digit from 0 to 9\n",
    "    \\w, stands for single word, Any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character. (Think of this as matching “word” \n",
    "    characters.)\n",
    "    \\s stands for single space character, Any space, tab, or newline character. (Think of this as matching “space” \n",
    "    characters.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "13) What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions? \n",
    "> \\D - > Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "    \\W - > Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character.\n",
    "    \\S - > Any character that is not a space, tab, or newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) What is the difference between .*? and .*? \n",
    "> .* - > The dot-star uses greedy mode: It will always try to match as much text as possible.\n",
    "    .*? - > To match any and all text in a non-greedy fashion, use the dot, star, and question mark (.*?). Like with \n",
    "    braces, \n",
    "    the question mark tells Python to match in a non-greedy way.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase \n",
    "letters with a character class? \n",
    "> Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "16) What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive? \n",
    "> Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "17) What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()? \n",
    "> The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. \n",
    "    If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18) If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?"
