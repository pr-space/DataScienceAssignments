    "1) What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ? \n",
    "> Both lambda and def create function objects to be called later\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the benefit of lambda? \n",
    "> makes code concise and compact\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "> map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong. reduce , on the other hand, takes all of the elements in an array and reduces them into a single value\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "> They are used to add info about the arguments to the function and make no difference to the interpreter.\n",
    "Function annotations, available in 3.X (3.0 and later), are syntactic embellishments of a function’s arguments and result, which are collected into a dictionary assigned to the function’s __annotations__ attribute. Python places no semantic meaning on these annotations, but simply packages them for potential use by other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Annotations for simple parameters : The argument name is followed by ‘:’ which is then followed by the expression. Annotation syntax is shown below.\n",
    "def foobar(a: expression, b: expression = 5):\n",
    ">> Annotations for excess parameters : Excess parameters for e.g. *args and **kwargs, allow arbitrary number of arguments to be passed in a function call. Annotation syntax of such parameters is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "def foobar(*args: expression, *kwargs: expression):\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Annotations for nested parameters : Nested parameters are useful feature of python 2x where a tuple is passed in a function call and automatic unpacking takes place. This feature is removed in python 3x and manual unpacking should be done. Annotation is done after the variable and not after the tuple as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "def foobar((a: expression, b: expression), (c: expression, d: expression)):\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Annotations for return type : Annotating return type is slightly different from annotating function arguments. The ‘->’ is followed by expression which is further followed by ‘:’. Annotation syntax of return type is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "def foobar(a: expression)->expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What are recursive functions, and how are they used? \n",
    "> Recursion is a technique used to solve computer problems by creating a function that calls itself until your program achieves the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "> Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Names and Instance Variables\n",
    "Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python’s name mangling rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named __a, it cannot be accessed by Foo.__a. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling Foo._Foo__a.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
