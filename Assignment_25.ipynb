    "1) What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses? \n",
    "> Square brackets are lists while parentheses are tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "> Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function? \n",
    "> If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) What is the purpose of a yield statement? \n",
    "> Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed a generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? \n",
    "> List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n",
    "    \n",
    "    List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
    "    Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required).\n"
